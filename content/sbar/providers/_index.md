Every provider uses the same item structure. Start with `id` and `type`, then add the settings listed on its page. Shared styling, actions, and refresh controls are available to every provider. Use [`text` templates](/sbar/configuration/text-templates/) to customise displayed labels; provider pages describe their default labels.

## Layout items

Use these items for fixed text, containers, and spacing. See [shared item options](/sbar/configuration/items/) for containers and overflow.

| Type | Configuration | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | `text` | Static text or a template using `id` and `value`; empty when omitted. |
| `group` | `children` | Inline children, nesting up to eight levels. |
| `popup` | `text`, `children` | Click to reveal children; label defaults to the item ID unless overridden. |
| `divider` | Shared styling | Vertical separator. |
| `spacer` | No dedicated options | Flexible empty space. |
