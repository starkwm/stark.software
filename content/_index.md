**Stark Software** is a collection of [open-source][starkwm] macOS apps designed to boost productivity. Each app started as a solution to a problem I personally faced.

## How it started

I built the first version of **Stark** in [early 2016][first-commit] while learning Swift. It started as a tool I wanted for myself — something that made managing windows on macOS feel fast, intentional, and effortless.

Because macOS doesn’t offer native window management APIs in the SDK, **Stark** is powered by a combination of the [Accessibility API][ax-api] and carefully used private frameworks. Over the past decade, it has evolved continuously — refined through real‑world use, and inspired by the [incredible open‑source][amethyst] macOS [window manager community][yabai].
